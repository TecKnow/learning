    "Real world data almost always varies, so \"correct\" values are just tightly packed distributions around the ideal value.  You almost never wnat those ordinary variations to have much of an effect on measurements and monitoring.  It's almost impossible to fill, for example, soda bottles to the exact same amount every time.  A bottle that's over or under by only 1 ml doesn't matter to your understanding of the variation nearly as much as one that it sover or under by, say, 10 ml."
